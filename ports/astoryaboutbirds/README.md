## Notes

Key Features
- Collect branches and seeds in form of a minigame that requires skill! The better you do, the harder it will become, but you'll gather a lot more!
- Build fancy shelters for the birds roaming around on the farm! These winged creatures are hungry beasts, though, so keep them well-fed, or they might just decide to leave again.
- Get to know the inhabitants of Plumage Farm and explore its various nooks and spots. You might find something unexpected!
- Enjoy this relaxing day on the farm. How many shelters can you build? How many birds can you provide for?
- This is a short experience, intended to be finished in under an hour. But there is good reason to play it a few times. ðŸ™‚
