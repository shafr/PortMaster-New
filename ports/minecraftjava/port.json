You start in a big, blocky world with nothing, and little by little, you gather, build, explore, and create your own adventures. Whether you're surviving the night or just chilling in Creative mode building dream houses, it\u2019s a game about freedom, creativity, and having fun your own way.\n\nNot all versions are Supported, currently only 1.7.10 (with Forge), 1.12 (with Forge) and 1.16.5 (Fabric only) are supported",
