    <desc>Always Surrender is a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up score attack, with an emphasis on pushing your luck as far as you can. Last as long as possible against an endless horde of enemies and then surrender in order to bank the bonus. Giving up has never been so rewarding. Battle a never ending swarm of enemies, but be sure to surrender before you die...</desc>
